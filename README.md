# Unfuck the Internet
This is my personal Ublock Origin filter list to remove annoying things that get past other adblock filters.

1. I don't like mobile websites bugging me to install their mobile app
2. I don't like videos in news sites that pop out and stick to the screen
3. I don't like "subscribe to my email list" and other similar popups
4. I don't like "this site uses cookies" notifications
5. I don't like sites that beg to disable adblocker

## 1. Adblocker Filter List

Installing the filter list will solve most problems, but don't forget to also install the user script below!

### Chrome

1. Install [Ublock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) (or equivalent).
2. [Subscribe to the filter list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/filters.txt) at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/filters.txt

### Firefox (Desktop and Mobile)

1. Install [Ublock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=search) (or equivalent) from the [Firefox Add-Ons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/).
2. [Subscribe to the filter list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/filters.txt) at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/filters.txt

### Adblock Browser (Android)

1. [Download and install the browser from the app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.browser)
2. Open the browser. Go to Settings -> Ad blocking -> More blocking options -> Add other filter list
3. Type in or copy/paste this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/filters.txt

## 2. User Script

### Chrome

1. Install a userscript extension like [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag?hl=en)
2. Add a new userscript from this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/userscript.js

### Firefox (Desktop)

1. Install a userscript extension like [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
2. Add a new userscript from this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/userscript.js

### Firefox (Mobile)

1. Firefox mobile has made an unfortunate decision to treat extensions with a walled garden approach, following Chrome's lead. At least for now, you can install a userscript extension like [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) by hacking your way around the problem. Follow this article's instructions: https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/
2. After the userscript extension is installed, add a new userscript from this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/userscript.js
