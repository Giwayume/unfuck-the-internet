# Unfuck the Internet
This is just my personal Ublock Origin filter list to remove annoying things that get past other adblock filters.

1. I don't like mobile websites bugging me to install their mobile app
2. I don't like videos in news sites that pop out and stick to the screen
3. I don't like "subscribe to my email list" and other similar popups
4. I don't like "this site uses cookies" notifications
5. I don't like advertisements
6. I don't like sites that beg to disable adblocker
