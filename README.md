# Unfuck the Internet
This is just my personal list to remove annoying things that get past other adblock filters.

1. I don't like mobile websites bugging me to install their mobile app
2. I don't like "subscribe to my email list" and other similar popups
3. I don't like "this site uses cookies" notifications
4. I don't like advertisements
5. I don't like sites that beg to disable adblocker

### Firefox Mobile

1. Install [Ublock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=search) (or equivalent) from the [Firefox Add-Ons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/).
2. [Subscribe to the filter list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/filters.txt).
3. Enjoy!

### Adblock Browser (Android)

1. [Download and install the browser from the app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.browser)
2. Open the browser. Go to Settings -> Ad blocking -> More blocking options -> Add other filter list
3. Type in or copy/paste this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giwayume/unfuck-the-internet/master/filters.txt
